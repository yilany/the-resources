## My LL Bio
Hi! My name is Yilan Yang, and I have been a Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellow for the past two years. I am class of 2020, and I study Applied Math at the college. When I was on campus, I filmed a lot of tutorials and worked with video editing. Now that I am off campus, I have focused on Adobe Creative Cloud and distance learning. It is important to work with different mediums at a place like Harvard because everyone communicates and learns differently. Now that everything is online, it is becoming more and more important to figure out new ways to communicate and teach using creative mediums that are engaging, accessible, and educational.
